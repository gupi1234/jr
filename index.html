            <strong>IN botany</strong>,
            <em> tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem</em>, or
            trunk,<br />

              >branches and leaves.</a
            >
            In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,<br />
            including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are
            usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.<br />
            In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
            bamboos are also trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trees are not<strong> a monophyletic taxonomic </strong> group but
            consist of a wide variety of plant<br />
            species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
            way to tower above <br />
            other plants to compete for<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight"
              >sunlight</a
            >. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the
            rest,<em> many are gymnosperms or softwoods</em>. Trees tend to be
            long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.<br />
            Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated
            that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.

              >A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of
              the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody
              tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from
              one part of the tree to For most trees it is surrounded by a layer
              of bark which serves as a protective barrier . Below the ground,
              the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the
              tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above
              ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The
              shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and
              convert it into sugars by
